# Pegasus Inheritance Project

This project demonstrates the concept of inheritance in Python by creating a `Pegasus` class that inherits from both `Horse` and `Eagle` classes.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pegasus-inheritance.git
cd pegasus-inheritance


Usage
To use the Pegasus class, create an instance of the class and call its methods. For example:


p1 = Pegasus()
p1.move(10, 15)
print(p1.get_pos())  # Output: (10, 15)
p1.voice()  # Output: Frrr (default sound of the Horse class)


Running Tests

python -m unittest main.test
